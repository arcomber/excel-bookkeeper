# excel-bookkeeper

A bookkeeping application in Excel.  Understanding of double entry bookkeeping concepts is required to enter transactions in the journal.

The design of the spreadsheet based on the excellent book Double Entry Bookkeeping, available on Amazon: https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B077KT965N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_351_o03?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1.  Not that I am in no way affiliated with the author.  For a clear understanding of how double entry bookkeeping works this is an excellent resource.  Old School style.

The journal is pre-populated with transactions from the book above.

How to use:

1. Edit the Chart of Accounts table.  Note that Type must be one of 4 hard-coded types: Assets, Expenses, Income or Liabilities.  The second column should be populated with your specific account.  For example, if you prefer to have a account to represent your bank account named 'Bank' then you would enter Assets under Type and Bank under the Account Name column.
2. Enter transactions in the Journal tab.  Note that double entry bookkeeping is assumed so you enter two lines for each 'transaction'.  See examples from book to get an idea.  First column is date of transaction, 2nd column is a unique identifier which must be the same for the 2 sides of the transaction, then by convention enter the Debit line first and the debit amount, second entry should be the credit.  There is a Comments field for some optional information, and an optional Done column where you can mark off processing of items with an x (or anything).
